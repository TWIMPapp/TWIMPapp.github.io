# Social Stomach

Real world ants have two stomachs, one for themselves and one for the colony (a.k.a. their social stomach). Your worker or drone ant is no different. When you collect food, you are also sharing food with your colony with a net benefit of 50% which is critical for its survival. Each ant in your colony will receive an equal amount of food which fills up a little of their food bar. Once your food bar is full, a new fresh item of food is created which you can then choose to eat yourself or give to another member of your colony.

**Note:** A queen can not collect food. Social stomach is required for their survival. For the queen!
