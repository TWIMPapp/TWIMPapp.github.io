# Energy

Each Adventure Ant has an energy bar. Collecting coins is hard work for an ant and will sap 0.5 of your energy for each coin you pick up. You cannot collect any more coins once your energy reaches zero and you cannot have more energy than the maximum available for your ant caste and its accessories.

**Note:** Energy does not recharge by itself and requires food collection.
