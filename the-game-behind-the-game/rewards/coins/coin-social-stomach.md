# Coin Social Stomach

The social stomach plays a role here too. As an ant, when you complete a trail, an additional 50% of the coins you collected will be equally airdropped to every member of your colony. Should you be a colony member who has no access to trails just yet, donâ€™t worry, you can effectively stake your ant in an active colony and earn food and coins through the social stomach mechanic.
