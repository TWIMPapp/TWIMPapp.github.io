# Treasure chests

Your ant can find chests with a rare drop rate whilst on your adventure in the real world. Their location is highly unpredictable (or maybe not ðŸ‘€). But finding one is a real prize. You can expect a supply of food, a bounty of coins, a worker NFT, or maybe something even betterâ€¦! There are a wide variety of Treasure Chests out there and certain ant traits can help you find them.

To open a Treasure Chest youâ€™d need a key. A key is purchasable using $PLAY and is a one time use. Keys and chests are tokens and can be resold on a secondary market if desired. Not all keys are made equal and you may need special ones for special chests.
