# Badges

There is an active badge system inside Twimp to allow our users to get rewarded for completing certain verified trails or unique feats. For example, should you be the first person to climb Mount Snowdon using the Snowdon trail, you’d get a badge as a unique NFT minted with your adventure (climb) duration “time to climb” and placement. Rarity of the badges depend on market dynamics. Should you be the 100th person to climb Snowdon, your badge will likely be common but will be another badge to add to the portfolio.

Collecting these badges is an incentive for you to unlock further badges by conquering other feats. Let’s say there’s a “UK‘s Biggest Mountains” badge collection. Should you be the first person to peak the mountains Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike you now own 3 NFTs minted with your time to climb and placement (number 1!) with legendary status because it's the first. Who knows if other collectors may see value in purchasing those off you in the future.

Then consider that in the future children can collect these badges for completing educational trails and you can hopefully see the potential of good these badges could deliver. We’re very excited to see how these dynamics play out.
