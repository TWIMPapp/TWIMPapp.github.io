# Upkeep

To encourage a fair competition we have the idea of territory upkeep. The more territory your colony owns, the more upkeep you need to spend in order to maintain. The price will be a certain percentage of coins and effectively be a tax on colony coin collection. Should you not be able to pay your upkeep for a given territory it will slowly revert back to its neutral state. Low upkeep also incentivises other colonies from taking advantage by attempting to claim the territory themselves.
