# DominANT World Cup

Collecting coins and food, what’s it all for?

If anything should make you bullish, it's this. Have you played Civilization™ or Risk™ or any game consisting of territory based ownership and loved it? Well, we’re going to play a game of Risk™ but the board is the real world and you and your ant are the player. Curious? Read on.

Each species has a colour and now commences a contest for territory. The more active a species is within a certain territory, the more ownership they hold. The idea being that territory will be filled with the colour of that ant’s species. Let’s take Cardiff in Wales, UK for example. Should the red species of ants complete trails and quests within Cardiff county they will eventually turn the county red. Should they continue to do the same in all regions of Wales, they will eventually turn the whole country red. Are you a yellow ant? Then it’s your job to stop them!

To begin with, the world will be neutral. When ants enter the world (with a randomly minted species colour) they will immediately begin to have an impact. When you, in the real world, complete trails, explore nature, collect food or have various other interactions on Twimp, you will be making an impact for your species and colony.

It's realistic to think that a queen of a red colony would be keen to own territory as soon as possible as territory ownership gives benefits. Firstly, the species who owns that territory will have +10% increase in energy and secondly, the specific colony who owns that territory will have a further +10% increase in energy. Going back to our Cardiff example, when the reds have taken over this territory, if you are in the red species and also in the red colony with the greatest ownership then you will have a +20% energy boost. You will have an easier time collecting coins which in turn will speed up your evolution to become a drone for your queen to breed.

Can’t get out there and play yourself? No problem, each day your colony’s efforts are bringing you back food. If you don’t need it, you can help your fellow species and colony members by dropping food for them on any trail of your choosing. We see this as a way to keep NFT holders keen who may not be in the region or even the country. You can still aid your colony to victory.
