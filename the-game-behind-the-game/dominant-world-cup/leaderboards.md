# Leaderboards

To determine territory ownership between colonies we will have leaderboards. You will be able to see a territory’s current ownership level by species and colony very easily. You’ll also be able to see the biggest contributors in various categories such as trails completed, coins collected etc. Leaderboards are something which will change the more usage with the application we see.
