# Species Quests

Same dynamic as colony quests but on a larger scale. The highest ranked colony within the species leads the charge. The queen of the speciesâ€™ highest ranked colony can set quests (species wide) in the effort to increase the species territorial gain as a whole. For example, the highest ranking red queen could set a quest for all red species ants to start creating trails in Scotland over the next 4 days which they will verify for quality. Highest quality wins a reward.
