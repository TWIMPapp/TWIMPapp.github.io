# Colony Quests

Queens can set daily, weekly and monthly quests for their colony to achieve. The queen sets the strategy for the colony based on which types of quests they choose. For example, they could set a weekly quest of raiding Dorset, UK by completing as many trails as possible in their bid for territorial reign. Remember, ants have different attributes and therefore different skills, to achieve the quest objective, you may need the right team.
