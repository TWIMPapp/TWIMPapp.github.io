# Traits

Each worker or drone ant has a series of traits and each has its own utility, some are known and will be shared below but others you’ll have to figure out for yourself.

| Accessory slot | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Colour         | Depicts the species your ant belongs to. Deliberately and categorically no additional utility will be given based on this trait. However, maybe of all the colonies, one stands out to be the cool kids and who doesn’t want to be in that colony!? |
| Head           | Some ants get a hat…you can tell a lot about an ant by their choice of hat… or not.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Body           | Some ants have the cool and aesthetic benefit of wearing a top. Somewhat inline with local fashion.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feet           | Some ants will receive either sandals, walking shoes or hiking boots. This has the benefit of increasing a player’s collection radius. You’ll see what we mean when you play.                                                                       |
