# Colonies

Each colony forms independent teams within a species. This is the social aspect of the game and where you can interact with others in the same colony and share your adventures. Each colony will be run by a queen who is also a player. Therefore, strategy would be dynamic between colonies and we can’t wait to see how that plays out.

Colonies may choose to create private channels on Discord or other platforms exclusively for their members (effectively operate as their own DAO if they so wish). By working together as a colony and playing the game, you can also compete to win the DominANT World Cup (more on that later).

The success of the colony will largely depend on its leader. A good leader will spread the word of Twimp and its mission far and wide, delegate responsibilities and encourage more players and more owners of ants and other tokens. They will also encourage their members to do the same and to work together for the common good of the colony.

It’s all about creating friendly competition between colonies and species. But if you don’t like the direction of your colony, for a price you will be able to defect to another within the same species. If you’re feeling particularly mischievous, maybe you’ll even choose to be a double agent.

OK, time to explain the hierarchy within the colony.
