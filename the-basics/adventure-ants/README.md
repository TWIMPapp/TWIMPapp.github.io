# Adventure Ants

The Adventure Ants is the Web 3.0 world of Twimp and so we sought inspiration from the real world for our creature. The humble ant is everywhere, it’s the world’s most travelled animal with superhuman strength so we decided to bring an ant inspired collection to the Solana blockchain and start an epic adventure the likes of which have never been seen before.

Real world utility is our aim - we can’t emphasise this enough. We think the new world of NFTs is truly remarkable and will help to mould the future. However, fundamentals do matter, our NFTs must have real world utility for them to remain valuable over time. Whilst we do think the ants look pretty cool, that’s not enough and if you share that sentiment, we would love to have you join our DAO.

At the most basic level, we need to monitor a healthy marketplace so that our NFTs can retain value in their own right. In addition, Twimp as a business must execute and be transparent in documenting its journey. The platform needs to be developed, the community built, revenues need to be correctly distributed and rewards should be given to all NFT holders whether that’s through merchandise, dividends or other real world benefits.

We want you and everyone you know out in the real world enjoying nature. To help nudge you in that direction we’re making things fun by gamifying these activities. That’s exactly why we’re called Twimp (The World Is My Playground). There’s so much fun to be had out there, and the Adventure Ant collection is an opportunity to play, explore and learn in a brand new way.

If you thought the Twimp App sounded cool, you’ve not seen anything yet. Welcome to the game behind the game!
