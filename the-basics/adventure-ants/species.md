# Species

Going back to the real world, we have thousands of species of ants but they tend to fall into 4 different categories which we denote by colour. The species is only important for team membership and has no utility difference.

| Colour | Utility                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| Black  | Can join Black colonies  |
| Green  | Can join Green colonies  |
| Red    | Can join Red colonies    |
| Yellow | Can join Yellow colonies |

Within each species, there are multiple colonies.
