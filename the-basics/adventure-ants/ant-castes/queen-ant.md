# Queen Ant

The Queen ant is the leader of the colony and oversees the comings and goings of all ants in their colony. They are the coordinator, the advocate, the strategist.

The Queen is the biggest ant with the highest energy (can collect lots of coins! ðŸ‘€). They are also the only caste which can see the value of each food item, unfortunately though they cannot collect it. With an abundance of energy they should have the easiest time collecting coins and managing their territory which makes them exceedingly rare and valuable. Plus, they have incredible wings.

In addition, the queen is the main benefactor of the monthly breeding event, a process that airdrops new Worker Ant NFTs for them to do as they see fit.

Butâ€¦ with great power comes great responsibility. The Queen is the undisputed leader of its colony, but it is also entirely dependent on its colony for food. Lead well; power is not guaranteed forever.
