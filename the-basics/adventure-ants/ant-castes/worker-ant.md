# Worker Ant

Lastly, we have the worker ant. The workhorse of the colony (as you’d imagine given their name) but their efforts as heroes of the colony cannot be overlooked. That’s simply why our initial collection is made up of these little creatures.

Worker ants can collect coins and food and although they may not be perceived as the highest ranking officials, they are unique in that they are the only caste which can evolve. In exchange for $PLAY, you can choose to evolve into a drone at any time once you have acquired enough $PLAY to make the transition.

**Note:** Evolution is a one time event and cannot be undone. The worker ant involved will be burned to maintain the collection size as a fixed quantity.
