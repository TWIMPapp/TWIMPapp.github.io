# Drone Ant

The drone ant could be seen as second in command after the queen, their job is to protect the queen and take part in breeding. Some say this is the best existence, I’ll let you decide… they also have cool wings.

Drones are randomly selected to breed with the queen of their own colony during the monthly breeding event. Afterwards, the lucky drone will receive a small percentage of the worker ant offspring by airdrop. This alone is a great benefit to incentivise the costs of evolving from a worker ant. You also have more energy available to you as a drone.
