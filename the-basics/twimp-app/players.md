Once in, you can search for trails that are nearby, you can read what the experience involves and take note of attributes about the trail that may be important. For example, distance to be covered, whether there is parking nearby, access to toilets, suitability for dogs and many other considerations.

Then, by using your GPS location, the app requires you to physically travel to the beginning of the trail before you can request the first task. Trails are made up of steps (actual locations) and within those steps the player is expected to complete one or more tasks. Some tasks simply provide information and others could require answering questions to move forward.

Once the player completes all tasks across all steps, they will have completed the trail and will receive their reward.

These adventures could be just about anything, you could be solving a criminal case, a 3D geographical puzzle, learning about important people that lived in your area, reading a book, foraging for wild food or just collecting some snaps to post on Insta. The main priority is that whatever you’re doing, you’re outside!
