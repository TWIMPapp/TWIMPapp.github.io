# Creators

Whatever the adventure, behind it is a creative soul. These are the pioneers that discovered the amazing walk, that wrote the book, that researched the local history.

Twimp needs lots of creators, each with their own style to share with others what they themselves would wish to find. Itâ€™s not all that different from your favourite YouTuber except these creators edit their content with their feet.

We have developed a UI for creating trails. Currently this is only used by us but our intention is to open this up to other creators as soon as possible. The flexibility of this creation platform is an essential piece of the player experience as it needs to support the endless bounds of human creativity.
