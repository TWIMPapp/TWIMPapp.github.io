# Future Roadmap

As the community grows, we will also develop a roadmap of new features that maximises the potential of our creators and in turn the games that players can experience.

Below are just a few of the ideas that we see as being great early additions to the platform.

1. Task types. Audio/video within tasks or new types of mini games e.g. wordle, jigsaws
2. Optional steps. Hidden information or clues that make each player’s experience unique
3. Decision trees. Interactive stories where the player gets to choose the path they take
4. Boundaries. Games where players evade detection or capture a moving target
5. Many many more, some of which we’d like to keep under wraps for now.

Aside from the revenue streams already identified, a flexible platform for creating real world outdoor experiences has additional commercial value. This could potentially be white-labelled to many other businesses for various uses, e.g. travel tours, large events, team building, tourist information.

Twimp has seemingly endless potential for delivering fun and educational experiences in the real world. We want everyone out there in nature, having a great time with friends and family - and we want your help in creating that future.
