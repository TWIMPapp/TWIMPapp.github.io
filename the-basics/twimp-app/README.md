# Twimp App

You know why we are here and hopefully why you are reading this paper. Now we will explain where we are with the Web 2.0 app, itâ€™s free to download and will remain so. Our users are basically split into two categories, those that play the games (the Players) and those that create the games in the first place (the Creators). And yes, you can be both.

**Note:** Twimp is an Android application installable from the Play store. It is currently in Alpha release and only available in the UK. We hope for this to change quickly.
