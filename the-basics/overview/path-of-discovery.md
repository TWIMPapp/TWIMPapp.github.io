# Path of Discovery

As a human species the way we educate our children needs to evolve to keep pace with our technological advancement. Right now, it’s still largely based on the factory worker method of teaching which we now understand just doesn’t work for everyone and that a disruptive, uninterested and under-performing child in school could otherwise thrive in the right setting.

An increasing number of our children nowadays move from the indoor classroom to digital devices at home. Whilst the scope for personalised learning on a digital device is immense, we seem to have acquired the collective opinion that learning and discovery must be done indoors and that is a mistake.

Twimp attempts to bridge the gap between captivating learning resources and outdoor play; we aim to produce experiences which parents and children can do together in a safe and fun way. As well as school educated children, Twimp also aims to provide resources for other educational clubs e.g. Scouts/Brownies or those that choose to home-school.
