# Why an NFT Collection?

At Twimp we are trying to create an ecosystem of outdoor opportunity and inspiration. It’s a long road but it starts by simply re-engaging humanity with the outdoors. At first we will create entertaining and engaging activities, everything from basic walks and history tours to murder mysteries and Da Vinci code-esque treasure hunts. We will also be engaging with schools and other education providers to give parents and teachers a new platform to encourage their children to learn and play.

A lot of these activities already exist in fragmented ways. There are scavenger hunt apps, paper-based treasure trails and often trails organised by local councils and independent businesses. We will bring these and much more together into a single app that aims to be the de facto place for outdoor entertainment, monetised where appropriate by directly related businesses that compliment the system.

This NFT collection is about focusing these resources together towards a common goal, gathering like minded people who believe in our mission and want to help inject more fun into the world. All while raising investment to extend these resources across the world.

A win-win-win scenario in our eyes.

We’ve chosen the Solana blockchain for our collection due to its sustainability efforts that allowed it to reach carbon neutrality in 2021.
