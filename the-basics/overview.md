# Overview

We are Twimp (The World Is My Playground). As a company we have two main goals.

1. To encourage all humans, especially the next generation to spend more time in the natural world to ultimately; love their planet
2. To give parents better resources to help them lead a path of discovery with their children through carefully architected and fun trails that encourage practical learning through play.

## Love Your Planet

Let's face it, becoming the “people” depicted in the Wall-E movie who are permanently attached to their devices, seems like a very bad idea. We’re already evolving into a cybernetic race and some think we are already there based on our attachment to our mobile devices. If technologies such as neuralink progress and the metaverse comes to be, we may indeed have to declare ourselves as no longer homo sapiens but rather some other, new variant.

We’re not anti-technology at all, having instant access to unlimited and accurate information is pretty cool actually, we just think being sat in an air conditioned room surrounded by screens is not how we should spend all of our time. In the modern era, humans as a species need to be fitter, healthier and more connected to the planet that we call home, whether that’s Earth, Mars or somewhere else. We need to learn to balance a sustainable love for nature with the technologies that allow humans to thrive and reach their potential.

On a very basic level, the way to remind people what an amazing world we have, is just to encourage people to spend more time in it. That’s why, at launch, Twimp is a Web 2.0 mobile app that people can pick up to find some sort of outdoor adventure trail nearby to complete. Some people enjoy going for walks and that’s great, but others need a little more engagement and that’s really where Twimp excels. Whether it’s murder mysteries, treasure hunts, stories or history trails that get you going, Twimp has something for you. And if it doesn’t, why not create it yourself?

The future of our planet will ultimately be decided by the next generation and we’re already aware that they have a bit of a job on their hands. But, let’s be honest, an increasing number of children would prefer to play in their virtual blocky world than the real one outside, and that might prove a little dangerous. So, when we’re rediscovering our planet, it would be ideal to take the children with us whenever possible. Plus, there is evidence that suggests children learn best through practical learning while playing. We can certainly help with that.

## Path of Discovery

As a human species the way we educate our children needs to evolve to keep pace with our technological advancement. Right now, it’s still largely based on the factory worker method of teaching which we now understand just doesn’t work for everyone and that a disruptive, uninterested and under-performing child in school could otherwise thrive in the right setting.

An increasing number of our children nowadays move from the indoor classroom to digital devices at home. Whilst the scope for personalised learning on a digital device is immense, we seem to have acquired the collective opinion that learning and discovery must be done indoors and that is a mistake.

Twimp attempts to bridge the gap between captivating learning resources and outdoor play; we aim to produce experiences which parents and children can do together in a safe and fun way. As well as school educated children, Twimp also aims to provide resources for other educational clubs e.g. Scouts/Brownies or those that choose to home-school.

## Why an NFT Collection?

At Twimp we are trying to create an ecosystem of outdoor opportunity and inspiration. It’s a long road but it starts by simply re-engaging humanity with the outdoors. At first we will create entertaining and engaging activities, everything from basic walks and history tours to murder mysteries and Da Vinci code-esque treasure hunts. We will also be engaging with schools and other education providers to give parents and teachers a new platform to encourage their children to learn and play.

A lot of these activities already exist in fragmented ways. There are scavenger hunt apps, paper-based treasure trails and often trails organised by local councils and independent businesses. We will bring these and much more together into a single app that aims to be the de facto place for outdoor entertainment, monetised where appropriate by directly related businesses that compliment the system.

This NFT collection is about focusing these resources together towards a common goal, gathering like minded people who believe in our mission and want to help inject more fun into the world. All while raising investment to extend these resources across the world.

A win-win-win scenario in our eyes.

We’ve chosen the Solana blockchain for our collection due to its sustainability efforts that allowed it to reach carbon neutrality in 2021.
