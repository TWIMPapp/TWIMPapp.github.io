# Adventure Ants

The Adventure Ants is the Web 3.0 world of Twimp and so we sought inspiration from the real world for our creature. The humble ant is everywhere, itâ€™s the worldâ€™s most travelled animal with superhuman strength so we decided to bring an ant inspired collection to the Solana blockchain and start an epic adventure the likes of which have never been seen before.

Real world utility is our aim - we canâ€™t emphasise this enough. We think the new world of NFTs is truly remarkable and will help to mould the future. However, fundamentals do matter, our NFTs must have real world utility for them to remain valuable over time. Whilst we do think the ants look pretty cool, thatâ€™s not enough and if you share that sentiment, we would love to have you join our DAO.

At the most basic level, we need to monitor a healthy marketplace so that our NFTs can retain value in their own right. In addition, Twimp as a business must execute and be transparent in documenting its journey. The platform needs to be developed, the community built, revenues need to be correctly distributed and rewards should be given to all NFT holders whether thatâ€™s through merchandise, airdrops or other real world benefits.

We want you and everyone you know out in the real world enjoying nature. To help nudge you in that direction weâ€™re making things fun by gamifying these activities. Thatâ€™s exactly why weâ€™re called Twimp (The World Is My Playground). Thereâ€™s so much fun to be had out there, and the Adventure Ant collection is an opportunity to play, explore and learn in a brand new way.

If you thought the Twimp App sounded cool, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Welcome to the game behind the game!

Starting with the ant hierarchy from the topâ€¦

## Tribes

Going back to the real world, we have thousands of species of ants but they tend to fall into 4 different tribes. The tribe is only important for team membership and has no utility difference.

| Tribe | Utility                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| Garden | Can join Garden colonies  |
| Tree | Can join Tree colonies  |
| Fire    | Can join Fire colonies    |
| Meadow | Can join Meadow colonies |

Within each tribe, there are multiple colonies.

## Colonies

Each colony forms independent teams within a tribe. This is the social aspect of the game and where you can interact with others in the same colony and share your adventures. Each colony will be run by a queen who is also a player. Therefore, strategy would be dynamic between colonies and we canâ€™t wait to see how that plays out.

Colonies may choose to create private channels on Discord or other platforms exclusively for their members (effectively operate as their own DAO if they so wish). By working together as a colony and playing the game, you can also compete to win the DominANT World Cup (more on that later).

The success of the colony will largely depend on its leader. A good leader will spread the word of Twimp and its mission far and wide, delegate responsibilities and encourage more players and more owners of ants and other tokens. They will also encourage their members to do the same and to work together for the common good of the colony.

Itâ€™s all about creating friendly competition between colonies and tribes. But if you donâ€™t like the direction of your colony, for a price you will be able to defect to another within the same tribe. If youâ€™re feeling particularly mischievous, maybe youâ€™ll even choose to be a double agent.

OK, time to explain the hierarchy within the colony.

## Ant Ranks

To replicate the ants role in the real world, we have three different rank of ants.

| Rank  | Energy | Utility                                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queen  | 5      | <ul><li>Leads a colony</li><li>Can mint new workers once a month</li><li>Can see quality of food</li><li>Can create trails</li><li>Can verify trails</li></ul> |
| Drone  | 3      | <ul><li>Can mint new workers once a month</li><li>Can create trails</li><li>Can verify trails</li></ul>                                                        |
| Worker | 2      | <ul><li>Can upgrade to a drone</li><li>Can create trails</li></ul>                                                                                  |

###  Queen Ant

The Queen ant is the leader of the colony and oversees the comings and goings of all ants in their colony. They are the coordinator, the advocate, the strategist.

The Queen is the biggest ant with the highest energy (can collect lots of coins! ðŸ‘€). They are also the only rank which can see the value of each food item, unfortunately though they cannot collect it. With an abundance of energy they should have the easiest time collecting coins and managing their territory which makes them exceedingly rare and valuable. Plus, they have incredible wings.

In addition, the queen is the main benefactor of the monthly mint event, a process that airdrops new Worker Ant NFTs for them to do as they see fit.

Butâ€¦ with great power comes great responsibility. The Queen is the undisputed leader of its colony, but it is also entirely dependent on its colony for food. Lead well; power is not guaranteed forever.

?> **Note:** Queens will be selected through community involvement then awarded with the NFT by DAO vote.

### Drone Ant

The drone ant could be seen as second in command after the queen, their job is to protect the queen and take part in minting workers. They also have cool wings.

Drones are randomly selected to mint with the queen of their own colony during the monthly mint event. Afterwards, the lucky drone will receive a small percentage of the worker ant offspring by airdrop. This alone is a great benefit to incentivise the costs of evolving from a worker ant. You also have more energy available to you as a drone.

### Worker Ant

Lastly, we have the worker ant. The workhorse of the colony (as youâ€™d imagine given their name) but their efforts as heroes of the colony cannot be overlooked. Thatâ€™s simply why our initial collection is made up of these little creatures.

Worker ants can collect coins and food and although they may not be perceived as the highest ranking officials, they are unique in that they are the only rank which can evolve. In exchange for $PLAY, you can choose to evolve into a drone at any time once you have acquired enough $PLAY to make the transition.

?> **Note:** Evolution is a one time event and cannot be undone. The worker ant involved will be burned to maintain the collection size as a fixed quantity.

## Traits

Each worker or drone ant has a series of traits and each has its own utility, some are known and will be shared below but others youâ€™ll have to figure out for yourself.

| Accessory slot | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Colour         | Depicts the tribe your ant belongs to. Deliberately and categorically no additional utility will be given based on this trait. However, maybe of all the colonies, one stands out to be the cool kids and who doesnâ€™t want to be in that colony!? |
| Head           | Some ants get a hatâ€¦you can tell a lot about an ant by their choice of hatâ€¦ or not.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Body           | Some ants have the cool and aesthetic benefit of wearing a top. Somewhat inline with local fashion.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feet           | Some ants will receive either sandals, walking shoes or hiking boots. This has the benefit of increasing a playerâ€™s collection radius. Youâ€™ll see what we mean when you play.                                                                       |

### Accessories

What is an adventure without an assortment of accessories!? Exactly. Your ant could have one or more of the following:

| Accessory        | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Penknife         | Increased energy addition from collected food.                         |
| Magnifying Glass | Itâ€™s amazing what you can see when you look closely.                   |
| Whistle          | Very good for getting the attention of your colony.                    |
| Water Bottle     | Itâ€™s important to stay hydrated on long walks.                         |
| Walkie Talkie    | Walkie Talkie club. Used for talking to other walkie talkie holders.   |
| Geiger Counter   | Useful for seeing the unseeable.                                       |
| Map              | If youâ€™re looking for certain collectibles, a map is very helpful      |
| Compass          | It might be broken, it definitely doesnâ€™t point north.                 |
| Torch            | Useful for finding reflective items and seeing in the dark.            |
| Binoculars       | Useful for finding things that are much further away.                  |
| Backpack         | Increased capacity for collecting coins.                               |
| Sunglasses       | The world looks a little different through sunglasses donâ€™t you think? |
