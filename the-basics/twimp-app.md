# Twimp App

You know why we are here and hopefully why you are reading this paper. Now we will explain where we are with the Web 2.0 app, it’s free to download and will remain so. Our users are basically split into two categories, those that play the games (the Players) and those that create the games in the first place (the Creators). And yes, you can be both.

?> **Note:** Twimp is an Android application installable from the Play store. It is currently in Alpha release and only available in the UK. We hope for this to change quickly.

## Players

Once in, you can search for trails that are nearby, you can read what the experience involves and take note of attributes about the trail that may be important. For example, distance to be covered, whether there is parking nearby, access to toilets, suitability for dogs and many other considerations.

Then, by using your GPS location, the app requires you to physically travel to the beginning of the trail before you can request the first task. Trails are made up of steps (actual locations) and within those steps the player is expected to complete one or more tasks. Some tasks simply provide information and others could require answering questions to move forward.

Once the player completes all tasks across all steps, they will have completed the trail and will receive their reward.

These adventures could be just about anything, you could be solving a criminal case, a 3D geographical puzzle, learning about important people that lived in your area, reading a book, foraging for wild food or just collecting some snaps to post on Insta. The main priority is that whatever you’re doing, you’re outside!

## Creators

Whatever the adventure, behind it is a creative soul. These are the pioneers that discovered the amazing walk, that wrote the book, that researched the local history.

Twimp needs lots of creators, each with their own style to share with others what they themselves would wish to find. It’s not all that different from your favourite YouTuber except these creators edit their content with their feet.

We have developed a UI for creating trails. Currently this is only used by us but our intention is to open this up to other creators as soon as possible. The flexibility of this creation platform is an essential piece of the player experience as it needs to support the endless bounds of human creativity.

## Future Roadmap

As the community grows, we will also develop a roadmap of new features that maximises the potential of our creators and in turn the games that players can experience.

Below are just a few of the ideas that we see as being great early additions to the platform.

1. Task types e.g. Audio/video within tasks or new types of mini games such as wordle or jigsaws.
2. Optional steps e.g. Hidden information or clues that make each player’s experience unique.
3. Decision trees e.g. Interactive stories where the player gets to choose the path they take.
4. Boundaries e.g. Games where players evade detection or capture a moving target.
5. Many many more, some of which we’d like to keep under wraps for now.

Aside from the revenue streams already identified, a flexible platform for creating real world outdoor experiences has additional commercial value. This could potentially be white-labelled to many other businesses for various uses, e.g. travel tours, large events, team building, tourist information.

Twimp has seemingly endless potential for delivering fun and educational experiences in the real world. We want everyone out there in nature, having a great time with friends and family - and we want your help in creating that future.
