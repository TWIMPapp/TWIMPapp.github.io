# Minting

We’re going to do our minting a little differently than other projects as we rely on the real world to provide utility. For that reason, on mint day 1 we will only mint 5,000 worker ants with a whitelist of 1,111 for a total supply of 10,000. The subsequent 5,000 ants will be minted through a monthly mint event and airdropped to queens and lucky drones.

Further series of worker ants will be minted and made available to meet demand in various countries around the world pending a DAO vote. For that reason, the initial mint will be dubbed the UK Adventure Ant (Alpha series).

No location locks to whomever would like to mint, but right now, we only operate within the UK. No utility outside the UK exists currently but is eagerly positioned on the roadmap. Nothing stops you getting an ant in preparation for the day we come to your country but DYOR please. If you do go ahead, even though you can’t play the game just yet, the social stomach game mechanic will look after you assuming you join an active colony. You will effectively be staking your ant for food and coins collected by the rest of your colony. Ants are incredibly altruistic.

?>**Note:** On mint day you are only minting a worker. Drones come from evolution mechanics and queens are gifted based on community involvement.

## Queen Creation

Queens are minted by the team, and on demand. The only dynamic here is to keep a firm queen to drone ratio. From day 1 we hope to have 4 queens, one for each species. Successful species who achieve multiple drones will earn the right to mint another queen. The queen selection process is an ongoing discussion but again it’s the DAO who decides who is the correct volunteer to take the reigns.

### Queen Monthly Mint
The benefit of the queen is that they can mint workers on a monthly basis. A large quantity of those randomly minted workers will be airdropped to the queen (with a smaller selection to the randomly selected drone who the queen bred with). This mechanic will continue until we’ve reached the total supply of worker NFTs in the current country and series. Various halving events will occur as time goes on to keep the system fair and functioning.

?>**Note:** After the airdrop the queen and drone are welcome to do with those newly minted workers as they see fit. Gift to community members, raffle for the benefit of the colony or simply sell on a secondary marketplace. They belong to the holder of the queen or its lucky drone partner.

## Drone Creation

Drones are minted when you evolve a worker. The drone will have all the same traits as your worker but change rank into a drone and grow some epic wings. Total supply will be the same as the series of workers you currently own. Your worker is burned once it evolves into a drone. There’s no going back.
