# DAO

We want this collection to be governed by a strong DAO. We’ve seen the incredible results of this in action and we believe that this collection is perfectly suited for the same treatment. Even though we have a caste system replicating the real world of the ant, with governance, there’s no hierarchy for voting. As long as you have $GPLAY tokens then you have governance within the project.

## Governance

Of the 11% market royalties, 5% is fixed income for the team, with the other 6% is funnelled into the DAO treasury pool. The DAO can vote on how they wish to spend the treasury. For example, they could issue a monthly airdrop, or start an education initiative at a local school, or a bit of both. That’s for the DAO to decide.

## Voting

Voting will be on chain and will require a lock period for the $GPLAY token you wish to use for voting. We’re also implementing the idea of vote power which is a trust multiplier for the lock period of your $GPLAY:

| Lock Period | Vote Multiplier |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 1 Month     | 0.25            |
| 3 Months    | 0.5             |
| 6 Months    | 1               |
| 12 Months   | 2               |

For example, if I’m placing a vote with 100 $GPLAY tokens I’ll be given the choice of a lock period. If I choose 3 months my vote will have a power factor of 0.5 giving me the effective vote power of 50 $GPLAY tokens. If I choose 12 months my vote will have a vote multiplier of 2 giving me the effective vote power of 200 $GPLAY tokens. You represent your confidence by your lock period.

?>**Note:** $GPLAY once locked cannot be reclaimed until the end of the lock period. No burning or loss takes place, you’ll get your $GPLAY back safe and sound after the lock period.

### Proposals

Any member of the DAO can put forward a proposal for vote consideration. The proposal should stay within the realm of DAO governance concerning $PLAY and $GPLAY tokens or the DAO treasury. There is a 100 $GPLAY lock period of 1 month to table a proposal.
