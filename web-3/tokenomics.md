# Tokenomics

**We have a utility token: $PLAY and a governance token: $GPLAY.**

To encourage growth there needs to be an asset that has real world value. Coin collection and subsequent swap for $PLAY allow real money to flow into the system. But also, the collection itself encourages participation with the real world. Ultimately the game needs players for it to grow and thus all investors benefit if people are encouraged to play.

## $PLAY

This is our utility token which is a 1:1 swap with the in game coins being collected by various activities such as completing trails. We’re operating with an unlimited supply as we want to maintain the collection and participation in the real world indefinitely. However, there will be a maximum yearly issuance cap, halving events and burning events to maintain a healthy economy. All these decisions would come through the DAO.

### Burning $PLAY

Initially, we will be burning $PLAY each time:

1. A worker is evolved into a drone (worker also burned)
2. An ant moves colonies within a species
3. DominANT territory upkeep costs
4. A key is bought for a treasure chest
5. A swap is made for our governance token $GPLAY

## $GPLAY

This is our governance token and is required for on chain voting in our DAO. There is a maximum supply of 3,000,000,000 which can only be gained by swapping, airdrops or open market purchase. To make sure we don’t use up all our governance in the early stages we’ll half the distribution every 3 years.

?>**Note:** Worker ants cannot swap $PLAY for $GPLAY.

### Distribution

$GPLAY will be distributed as follows:

* **60%** $PLAY swapping
* **15%** team
* **10%** DAO treasury
* **10%** private sale
* **5%** advisors
