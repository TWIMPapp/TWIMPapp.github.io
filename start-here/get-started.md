# Get Started

Twimp (The World is My Playground) is an outdoor game and learning resource in a handy mobile app. Trails will be scattered around the real world with a variety of types and difficulty. We strongly believe in teaching children how to learn and have fun in the natural world while giving parents the resources that allow their children's natural inclinations to emerge spontaneously. We would hope to expand our education role over time, seeking to have a Twimp presence in every schooling system across the world by 2042. You will be playing a critical role in that endeavour.

We've tried to break down our documentation as much as possible for you to consume as and when you have time. You don't need to read everything front to back right off the bat. Delve into bits and pieces that interest you.

Start with the [Tl;dr](/start-here/tl-dr.md). If a concept sounds interesting, jump to its page and read it through.
