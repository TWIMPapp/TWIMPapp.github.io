# DAO

We want this collection to be governed by a strong DAO. We’ve seen the incredible results of this in action and we believe that this collection is perfectly suited for the same treatment. Even though we have a caste system replicating the real world of the ant, with governance, there’s no hierarchy for voting. As long as you have $GPLAY tokens then you have governance within the project.
