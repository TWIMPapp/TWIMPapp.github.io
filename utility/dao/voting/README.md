# Voting

Voting will be on chain and will require a lock period for the $GPLAY token you wish to use for voting. We’re also implementing the idea of vote power which is a trust multiplier for the lock period of your $GPLAY:

| Lock Period | Vote Multiplier |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 1 Month     | 0.25            |
| 3 Months    | 0.5             |
| 6 Months    | 1               |
| 12 Months   | 2               |

For example, if I’m placing a vote with 100 $GPLAY tokens I’ll be given the choice of a lock period. If I choose 3 months my vote will have a power factor of 0.5 giving me the effective vote power of 50 $GPLAY tokens. If I choose 12 months my vote will have a vote multiplier of 2 giving me the effective vote power of 200 $GPLAY tokens. You represent your confidence by your lock period.

**Note:** $GPLAY once locked cannot be reclaimed until the end of the lock period. No burning or loss takes place, you’ll get your $GPLAY back safe and sound after the lock period.
