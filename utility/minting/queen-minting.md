# Queen minting

Queens are minted by the team, and on demand. The only dynamic here is to keep a firm queen to drone ratio. From day 1 we hope to have 4 queens, one for each species. Successful species who achieve multiple drones will earn the right to mint another queen. The queen selection process is an ongoing discussion but itâ€™s the DAO who decides who is the correct volunteer to take the reigns.
