# Minting

We’re going to do our minting a little differently than other projects as we rely on the real world to provide utility. For that reason, on mint day 1 we will only mint 5,000 worker ants with a whitelist of 1,111 for a total supply of 10,000. The subsequent 5,000 ants will be minted through a monthly breeding event and airdropped to queens and lucky drones.

Further series of worker ants will be minted and made available to meet demand in various countries around the world pending a DAO vote. For that reason, the initial mint will be dubbed the UK Adventure Ant (Alpha series).

No location locks to whomever would like to mint, but right now, we only operate within the UK. No utility outside the UK exists currently but is eagerly positioned on the roadmap. Nothing stops you getting an ant in preparation for the day we come to your country but DYOR please. If you do go ahead, even though you can’t play the game just yet, the social stomach game mechanic will look after you assuming you join an active colony. You will effectively be staking your ant for food and coins collected by the rest of your colony. Ants are incredibly altruistic.

**Note:** On mint day you are only minting a worker. Drones come from evolution mechanics and queens are gifted based on community involvement.
