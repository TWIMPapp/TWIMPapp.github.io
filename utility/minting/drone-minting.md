# Drone minting

Drones are minted when you evolve a worker. The drone will have all the same traits as your worker but change caste into a drone and grow some epic wings. Total supply will be the same as the series of workers you currently own. Your worker is burned once it evolves into a drone. Thereâ€™s no going back.
