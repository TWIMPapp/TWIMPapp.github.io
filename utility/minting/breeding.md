# Breeding

The benefit of the queen is that they can have babies on a monthly basis. The queen effectively mints a collection of new workers when they give birth. A large quantity of those randomly minted workers will be airdropped to the queen (with a smaller selection to the randomly selected drone who the queen bred with). This mechanic will continue until weâ€™ve reached the total supply of worker NFTs in the current country and series. Various halving events will occur as time goes on to keep the system fair and functioning.

**Note:** After the airdrop the queen and drone are welcome to do with those newly minted workers as they see fit. Gift to community members, raffle for the benefit of the colony or simply sell on a secondary marketplace. They belong to the holder of the queen or its lucky drone partner.
