# Tokenomics

**We have a utility token: $PLAY and a governance token: $GPLAY.**

To encourage growth there needs to be an asset that has real world value. Coin collection and subsequent swap for $PLAY allow real money to flow into the system. But also, the collection itself encourages participation with the real world. Ultimately the game needs players for it to grow and thus all investors benefit if people are encouraged to play.
