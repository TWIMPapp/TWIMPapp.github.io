# $GPLAY

This is our governance token and is required for on chain voting in our DAO. There is a maximum supply of 3,000,000,000 which can only be gained by swapping, airdrops or open market purchase. To make sure we don’t use up all our governance in the early stages we’ll half the distribution every 3 years.
