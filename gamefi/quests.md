# Quests

The purpose of quests is to increase the utility of a colony and the related tribe dynamic. Ultimately getting people out into the world having fun in nature, either individually or as part of a real-world meet up.

## Tribe Quests

Same dynamic as colony quests but on a larger scale. The highest ranked colony within the tribe leads the charge. The queen of the tribe’ highest ranked colony can set quests (tribe wide) in the effort to increase the tribe territorial gain as a whole. For example, the highest ranking Fire queen could set a quest for all Fire Tribe ants to start creating trails in Scotland over the next 4 days which they will verify for quality. Highest quality wins a reward.

## Colony Quests

Queens can set daily, weekly and monthly quests for their colony to achieve. The queen sets the strategy for the colony based on which types of quests they choose. For example, they could set a weekly quest of raiding Dorset, UK by completing as many trails as possible in their bid for territorial reign. Remember, ants have different attributes and therefore different skills, to achieve the quest objective, you may need the right team.
