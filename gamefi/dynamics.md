# Game Dynamics

So… ants work in a hierarchy and belong to colonies. By owning an Adventure Ant, you are part of the game and can join a colony of your choice. Then, it’s your job to do whatever it takes to serve your queen and work together to build the best colony possible.

You do this by collecting coins and food, by joining quests, executing strategies and finding treasure chests. But to do this, an ant needs energy so let’s start there.

## Energy

Each Adventure Ant has an energy bar. Collecting coins is hard work for an ant and will sap 0.5 of your energy for each coin you pick up. You cannot collect any more coins once your energy reaches zero and you cannot have more energy than the maximum available for your ant rank and its accessories.

?> **Note:** Energy does not recharge by itself and requires food collection.

## Food

Food will be scattered randomly throughout the real world and is a one time collection available for all ants. Food collected has a variety of energy effects depending on its freshness over a 72 hour period.

| Freshness | Time Since Spawn             | Energy Effect |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Legendary | `< 1 hour`                   | +1.5          |
| Epic      | > 1 `hour and < 12 hours`    | +1            |
| Rare      | `> 12 hours and < 24 hours`  | +0.5          |
| Common    | `> 24 hours and < 70 hours`  | +0.25         |
| Rotten    | `> 70 hours and < 72 hours`  | -0.25         |

### Social Stomach

Real world ants have two stomachs, one for themselves and one for the colony (a.k.a. their social stomach). Your worker or drone ant is no different. When you collect food, you are also sharing food with your colony with a net benefit of 50% which is critical for its survival. Each ant in your colony will receive an equal amount of food which fills up a little of their food bar. Once your food bar is full, a new fresh item of food is created which you can then choose to eat yourself or give to another member of your colony.

?>**Note:** A queen can not collect food. Social stomach is required for their survival. For the queen!
