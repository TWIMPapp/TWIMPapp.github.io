# DominANT World Cup

Collecting coins and food, what’s it all for?

If anything should make you bullish, it's this. Have you played Civilization™ or Risk™ or any game consisting of territory based ownership and loved it? Well, we’re going to play a game of Risk™ but the board is the real world and you and your ant are the player. Curious? Read on.

Each tribe has a colour and now commences a contest for territory. The more active a tribe is within a certain territory, the more ownership they hold. The idea being that territory will be filled with the colour of that ant’s tribe. Let’s take Cardiff in Wales, UK for example. Should the Fire Tribe of ants complete trails and quests within Cardiff county they will eventually turn the county red. Should they continue to do the same in all regions of Wales, they will eventually turn the whole country red. Are you a Water Tribe ant? Then it’s your job to stop them!

To begin with, the world will be neutral. When ants enter the world (with a randomly minted tribe colour) they will immediately begin to have an impact. When you, in the real world, complete trails, explore nature, collect food or have various other interactions on Twimp, you will be making an impact for your tribe and colony.

It's realistic to think that a queen of a Fire colony would be keen to own territory as soon as possible as territory ownership gives benefits. Firstly, the tribe who owns that territory will have +10% increase in energy and secondly, the specific colony who owns that territory will have a further +10% increase in energy. Going back to our Cardiff example, when the Fire Tribe have taken over this territory, if you are in the Fire Tribe and also in the specific Fire colony with the greatest ownership then you will have a +20% energy boost. You will have an easier time collecting coins which in turn will speed up your evolution to become a drone for your queen to start minting new workers.

Can’t get out there and play yourself? No problem, each day your colony’s efforts are bringing you back food. If you don’t need it, you can help your fellow tribe and colony members by dropping food for them on any trail of your choosing. We see this as a way to keep NFT holders keen who may not be in the region or even the country. You can still aid your colony to victory.

## Upkeep

To encourage a fair competition we have the idea of territory upkeep. The more territory your colony owns, the more upkeep you need to spend in order to maintain. The price will be a certain percentage of coins and effectively be a tax on colony coin collection. Should you not be able to pay your upkeep for a given territory it will slowly revert back to its neutral state. Low upkeep also incentivise other colonies from taking advantage by attempting to claim the territory themselves.

## Leaderboards

To determine territory ownership between colonies we will have leaderboards. You will be able to see a territory’s current ownership level by tribe and colony very easily. You’ll also be able to see the biggest contributors in various categories such as trails completed, coins collected etc. Leaderboards are something which will change the more usage with the application we see.
