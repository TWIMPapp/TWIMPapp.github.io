# Rewards

There are many ways to be rewarded while out exploring the real world with your Adventure Ant. Rewards mapped below for most common interactions:

| Interaction                                | Frequently Receive                                                                      | Rarely Receive                |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Completing a verified trail                | 1-6 coins                                                                   | Treasure chest, key |
| Opening a treasure chest                   | 0.4 coins                                                                   | Food, NFT, key      |
| Another ant completing a trail you created | 0.1-0.6 coins (10% of what a user receives for completing a verified trail) |                     |
| Coin share within a colony and tribe     | TBC                                                                         | TBC                 |

## Coins

Coins are what Twimp will pay users who complete trails and various other interactions. Collecting coins reduces your energy but it's something you are going to want to do as it impacts the entire game dynamic.

### Coin Social Stomach

The social stomach plays a role here too. As an ant, when you complete a trail, an additional 50% of the coins you collected will be equally airdropped to every member of your colony. Should you be a colony member who has no access to trails just yet, don‚Äôt worry, you can effectively stake your ant in an active colony and earn food and coins through the social stomach mechanic.

?> **Note:** In order to benefit from our utility token $PLAY you need to have a web3 wallet account set-up. Coins can only be swapped for $PLAY tokens for users with a Solana account address at this time. 1 coin = 1 $PLAY.

## Treasure chests

Your ant can find chests with a rare drop rate whilst on your adventure in the real world. Their location is highly unpredictable (or maybe not üëÄ). But finding one is a real prize. You can expect a supply of food, a bounty of coins, a worker NFT, or maybe something even better‚Ä¶! There are a wide variety of Treasure Chests out there and certain ant traits can help you find them.

To open a Treasure Chest you‚Äôd need a key. A key is purchasable using $PLAY and is a one time use. Keys and chests are tokens and can be resold on a secondary market if desired. Not all keys are made equal and you may need special ones for special chests.

| Chest Rarity | Key Required |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Mythic       | 1 Mythic     |
| Legendary    | 1 Legendary  |
| Epic         | 1 Epic       |
| Rare         | 1 Rare       |
| Uncommon     | 1 Uncommon   |
| Common       | 1 Common     |

## Badges

There is an active badge system inside Twimp to allow our users to get rewarded for completing certain verified trails or unique feats. For example, should you be the first person to climb Mount Snowdon using the Snowdon trail, you‚Äôd get a badge as a unique NFT minted with your adventure (climb) duration ‚Äútime to climb‚Äù and placement. Rarity of the badges depend on market dynamics. Should you be the 100th person to climb Snowdon, your badge will likely be common but will be another badge to add to the portfolio.

Collecting these badges is an incentive for you to unlock further badges by conquering other feats. Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúUK‚Äòs Biggest Mountains‚Äù badge collection. Should you be the first person to peak the mountains Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike you now own 3 NFTs minted with your time to climb and placement (number 1!) with legendary status because it's the first. Who knows if other collectors may see value in purchasing those off you in the future.

Then consider that in the future children can collect these badges for completing educational trails and you can hopefully see the potential of good these badges could deliver. We‚Äôre very excited to see how these dynamics play out.
