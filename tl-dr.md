# Tl;dr

Twimp (The World is My Playground) is an outdoor game and learning resource in a handy mobile app. Trails will be scattered around the real world with a variety of types and difficulty. We strongly believe in teaching children how to learn and have fun in the natural world while giving parents the resources that allow their children's natural inclinations to emerge spontaneously. We would hope to expand our education role over time, seeking to have a Twimp presence in every schooling system across the world by 2042. You will be playing a critical role in that endeavour.

To jump into the glossary, there are a bunch of things introduced with a fair amount of detail in this paper. You should read it all if you are interested in playing with us. But, for now, here are the basics:
