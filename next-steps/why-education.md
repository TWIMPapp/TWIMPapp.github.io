# Why Education?

As previously mentioned, education is one of the key goals of Twimp. We want our platform to be an alternative resource for parents, home-schoolers, schools and other educational environments looking to find new ways to inspire their children. As part of the game, we will already be acquiring some of the greatest creative minds and storytellers to our ecosystem; You, and the people that have a passion for sharing what they love and what they know.

People vastly underestimate just how much maths, language, art, music and science exist in the world around us. Even the smallest town is simply full of numbers, letters, words, colours, sounds, textures and shapes. Most of which go unnoticed as adults..

When you were at school, was it obvious to you why you were taught about battles and wars or why you needed to measure angles or name the parts of a plant? It would be far more engaging to stand on an historic battlefield and tell the story of someone who needed to be brave and then be ready to explain why they were there in the first place. It would make more sense that if a child is interested in bridges and how they are built you use that information to teach scientific concepts such as force and trigonometry. It would be more memorable to take a child on a foraging journey and then explain which parts of the plant you can eat and what seeds to plant to create new ones. These are the experiences the real world offers us that books, papers and stuffy old classrooms cannot.

The world of education is already changing with online courses from Coursera having seen rapid growth in recent years.

In the new world of the gig economy and flexible hours, more and more people are turning towards alternative education resources such as Coursera to extend their education or to reskill. In addition, we’ve already seen this trend of alternative learning for younger people, fast forwarded in the pandemic by a significant increase in homeschooling.

Technology is going to revolutionise the education industry and we believe that Twimp has a place in moving some of the classroom outside. We believe the next huge disruption or perhaps compliment to our sector will come from Augmented Reality (AR), and that’s when things get really exciting. And one, we believe, we've positioned ourselves well for.

With a current estimated market growth rate of 40% per year, we would hope that our DAO shares our belief in this technology. We still have a lot of work to do, but having a meaningful presence in both outdoor entertainment and education early on, will position us nicely to generate an ROI on the back of this technology that truly benefits everyone.

**On the basis that it’s fun, potentially lucrative and the right thing to do, we hope you’ll consider Twimp and its ant based ecosystem. As always DYOR and thank you for reading.**
